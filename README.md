## Story of the Game

> _Many years ago there was five suns in the sky, and five moons. Our land is called "Lands of Eternal Night" not by a coincidence, but because one of our suns faded away, leaving us with 6 months of severe cold nights, and only one month with suns in the sky._

> _Some prophets, halucinated by this misterious fading, proclaim that others suns will fade away... But the future lays on uncertanty, fear and mistery. Many adventurers that once had glory dwelving into the abyss, now is scared of what may be happening down the surface._

> _After the fading of the fifth sun, the cult of Vatos, the eternal waning moon, and god of the abyss, had an exponential growth, and his minions terrorize the citadels across the land._

#### We may need an adventure like you, to dwelve into the Witch lair and discover more about the cult and the fading of the 5th sun, Otris
